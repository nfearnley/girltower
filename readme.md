# Girl Tower
# by Natalie Fearnley

## Development Environment

Girl Tower is developed in [PICO-8 v0.2.1B](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php)

To be able to edit the cart from within PICO-8, open the PICO-8 [configuration file](https://pico-8.fandom.com/wiki/Configuration) and edit the `root_path` setting to point to this repo's folder.

Once the root_path is correct set, you can open the cart by typing `LOAD GIRLTOWER`. From there you can make your changes, then save the cart at any time using CTRL-S.

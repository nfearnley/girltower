## Development Environment
Girl Tower is developed in [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) v0.2.1B
To be able to edit the cart from within PICO-8, open the [config.txt](https://pico-8.fandom.com/wiki/Configuration) file and edit the `root_path` setting to point to this repo's folder.
Once the root_path is correct set, you can open the cart by typing `LOAD GIRLTOWER`. From there you can make your changes, then save the cart using CTRL-S.
